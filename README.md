## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before storage.
- JWT tokens are stored in **httpOnly cookies** for security.
- All sensitive routes are protected by middleware.
- Email verification and password reset links are time-limited and securely generated.

---

## üìß Email Setup

This template uses **Nodemailer** for sending emails.  
You can use [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) or any SMTP provider for development/testing.

---

## üìù Customization

- Update the UI in `/src/app` pages as needed.
- Extend the user model in `/src/models/user.model.js` for more fields.
